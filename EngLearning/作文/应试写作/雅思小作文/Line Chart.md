## Example

Line graph about electricity production in France.

## introduction

给出一个general的概括性的描述。

- The graph below shows electricity production in France between 1980 and 2012.

同义替换：

- The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.

## overview

细节对比

- It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown.
- Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

## detail

观点：核能重要

- In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France,generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawtt hours of electricity each,and renewables provided a **negligible** amount.
- Just one year later, nuclear power overtook thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

## detail 

1. Between 1980 and 2005,electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours.
2. By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 TW hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period.
3. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours,for the whole 32-year period,
4. but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.

## no conclusion

in Task1, there is no conclusion.  
you can put summary to the end,but dont write in conclusion,write in summary.

# from Prime Minister

## p1

**To put it simply**,Prime Minister,  

certain informal discussions took place **involving a full and frank exchange of views**,  

out of which there arose a series of **proposals** which proved to **indicate** certain promising lines of inquiry,  
which when pursued, led to the realisation that the alternative courses of action might, in fact, **in certain circumstances**, 

be susceptible of **discreet modification**, leading to a reappraisal of the areas of difference and **pointing the way** to encouraging possibilities of **compromise and cooperation** which,  

**if bilaterally implemented with** appropriate give and take on both sides, might, **if the climate were right**, have a possibility at the end of the day, of leading rightly or wrongly, **to a mutually satisfactory resolution.**

- discreet 小心严谨
- susceptible 易受影响

> 我们需要各种措施，来解决问题

From my perspective, as far as one can see, at this stage, it is high time to solve the issue while I believe several proposals can be raised and put into practice.

In such circumstances, taking a series of factors into long-term considerations and making full and reasonable exchanges of views among different individuals pointing us the way to (encouraging possibilities of compromise and cooperation between society and people) which, when the climate were right, if bilaterally implemented with appropriate methods, will lead to a mutually satisfactory resolution.

Prime minister  
I'm fully seized of your aims, and I'll do my utmost to put them into practice. I recommend we set up a committee with broad terms of reference,  
so at the end of the day we'll **be in the position** to think through the **various implications**
and decide **based on long-term consierations** rather than rush **prematurely** into precipitate and ill-conceived actions which might have **unforseen** repercussions.

- 草率的 precipitate
- 病态构想 ill-conceived
- 反弹,影响 repercussion
- 影响,后果 implication
- 不成熟的 prematurely
- 不可预料的 unforseen

### summary

- 处于..地步 be in the position
- 各种可能后果 various implications
